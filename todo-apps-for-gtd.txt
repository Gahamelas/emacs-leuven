*** Remember the Milk

You can create Smart Lists that only show:

- Tasks due in the upcoming month
- Tasks with no due date
- Tasks that have been completed in the past week
- Tasks with high priority
- Tasks with time estimates less than 1 hour
- Tasks that have been postponed 3 times already
- Tasks that are shared with anyone
- Tasks that are shared with Bob T. Monkey
- Tasks that are tagged with 'mall'
- Tasks that contain the word 'phone'

Smart Lists can also be based on multiple criteria, for example:

- Tasks in my 'Work' list with high priority
- Tasks that are high priority and due in the upcoming week
- Tasks that are high priority or medium priority
- Tasks that are shared with anyone due in the upcoming week
- Tasks that are tagged with both 'mall' and 'gift'

Combined with Fluid to turn the web application into a desktop tool, it's
a brilliant option if you need something that looks great.

* Designed for teamwork

** Doit.im

- State ::
     "Uncompleted" or "Completed".

*** Focus

All lists show the title and the deadline (in compact form: "X days overdue",
"due today", "X days left", "MM-DD" or "YYYY").

They're sorted on the deadline (no DEADLINE = last).

- Inbox ::
     (no SCHEDULED date)
     (Constraint: adding a project or a status [Today, Next, etc.] makes them
     *move* to Next)
     All to-dos to refine later.

- Today ::
     (SCHEDULED date = today, sorted by DEADLINE)
     (Grouped between "Do it now" and "Today others")
     Tasks starting or due today (*or before*).

General constraint for the other lists: Deadline date > today; if not, they go
to Today.

- Next ::
     (no SCHEDULED date)
     (Group by Project?)
     Actions to be done as soon as possible but with no exact start time.

- Tomorrow ::
     (SCHEDULED date = tomorrow)
     (Ungrouped)
     Tasks to be handled tomorrow.

- Scheduled ::
     (SCHEDULED date > tomorrow)
     (Group by Start time: "(after) tomorrow", "next (work) week" [up to
     Sunday], "this month", "next month and later")
     All to-dos with start time after tomorrow, including repeated ones.

- Someday ::
     (no SCHEDULED date)
     (Ungrouped)
     Tasks with no start time yet and probably to be done someday in the
     future.

- Waiting for ::
     (no SCHEDULED date)
     (Group by Contact: "Mine", ...)
     Tasks forwarded to others.

*** Projects

Show all tasks of a project, grouped by:

- Today

April Newsletter

Search Views ( http://connect.asana.com/1L9Q-1EBU8-8X1XHI-K4QCL-0/c.aspx )

Teams that are successful with Asana put everything in it, from daily tasks
and project work to high level goals and planning. Search Views, our newest
feature, gives you a powerful new way to locate a specific task, or build
custom views of your team's work.

Find Anything
Search Views allow you to find all the tasks that match your criteria for
assignee, creator, due date, project, tags and more. You can also search
across comments and notes! Save your searches to keep track of important lists
- such as unassigned tasks overdue across your team, or tasks you've assigned
to a new teammate.

Learn more about how Search Views work » (
http://connect.asana.com/1L9Q-1EBU8-8X1XHI-K4QCL-0/c.aspx )

The New Task Pane ( http://connect.asana.com/1L9Q-1EBU8-8X1XHI-K4QCM-0/c.aspx )

Notice Anything Different?
You may have noticed that we've given the Asana task pane a design overhaul.
We rebuilt it from the ground up, with the goal of simplifying, beautifying,
and improving the area of Asana where you track the details of your work. All
the same functionality is still there, but now with a more focused and elegant
interface.

Read about all the changes » ( http://connect.asana.com/1L9Q-1EBU8-8X1XHI-K4QCM-0/c.aspx )

Colored Projects and Tags ( http://connect.asana.com/1L9Q-1EBU8-8X1XHI-KBJNH-0/c.aspx )

Add a little color to your task list with colored project & tag labels. Give
any project or tag a color to help visually categorize and differentiate your
tasks. For example, add a red tag to high priority tasks to keep them top of
mind.

** [[https://www.azendoo.com/][Azendoo]]

Azendoo provides easy ways to organize your work, *without "work about work"*.

Tasks can be planned to be worked:
- on a *specific day*, making it a *priority* task on that specific day,
- *anytime in a week*, making it a *planned* task or
- for *someday*, making it an *unorganized* task.

*A new task is (by default) scheduled (= work planned) for today!*

    Un-SCHEDULE'ing it means setting it as SOMEDAY.

Tasks sometimes need some more details to be completed.  You may add checkboxes
*subtasks* to a task's description.

/Workspaces/ (= Org files) are where people work on /Subjects/ (like projects,
customers, departments, products, events, meetings, or anything you want) and
choose how involved they are in each.

Your workspace is organized into Subjects. An Azendoo Subject can be anything,
like a project, a client, a topic, a portfolio, an idea board, etc. And each
Subject regroups team members, tasks, documents and messages.

Task views:

- All

  All unfinished tasks, for everybody in my team:
  + Sorted by scheduled date
  + Someday for all the unscheduled tasks

- Planner (= My Tasks)

  All my unfinished and finished tasks:
  + Grouped per day, by scheduled date, for the coming 7 days \\
  + Grouped per week, by scheduled date, for the coming 4 weeks

- With a due date

  All unfinished tasks, sorted by target date (= deadline)

- Now

  All my unfinished and finished tasks, scheduled for today (unfinished + finished)

*** Documentation

- Due Date
- Reminder = email to remind me of a due date

The Tickler folder is a place to keep those non-actionable items that you need
to review at a later date. For example, if you get an email from a friend
about a Bruce Springsteen concert in August 2013, you could create a tickler
entry from that email and revisit it when tickets go on sale.

By doing this you can reach Inbox Zero, and you'll have the peace of mind that
you won't drop the ball on anything.

*** Hierarchical tasks or subtasks

Implement hierarchical tasks the way Trog Bar does ("Natural Project
Management"): any task becomes a project just by adding subtasks to it. These
projects should be a hybrid between tasks and workspaces, offering control
over dates, deadlines, delegation structure, etc. (like a task) while also
allowing you to manage a list of tasks and participants in the project (like a
workspace).

*** Documentation

"We try to follow the book Getting Things Done as close as possible so *we do
not allow sorting by task name or due date*, we only allow sorting by dragging
and dropping the tasks. We also sort by Scheduled Date if you drag a task in
to the scheduled folder. We think that you should sort your tasks manually and
then drag the tasks into "Today" that you want to do today."

What is the difference between Scheduled and Due Dates?

- Scheduled (for review)

  Think of Scheduled as "I want to review this task at a later date but get it
  out of my way for now". When you schedule a task, it will remain in the
  scheduled folder until the date you've specified. On that date, it will be
  moved into your "Today" folder. This is a great way to declutter your
  "Today" folder of tasks you don't want to do today but need to do it the
  next day or a specific day.

  To schedule a task for future review, just drag the task into the
  "Scheduled" category under your focus group on the left of your screen. You
  will see the following screen where you can specify when you want to see
  this task again:

- Due Dates

  Due dates are a way for you to visually see how long you have until the task
  is due. To set a due date, just click on "no due date" to the right of your
  task. This will pop up a dialog for you to set a due date:

  After you set due dates for your tasks, you can quickly see when all your
  tasks are due.

** Things

*Daily Review, Don't let anything fall through the cracks.*

http://culturedcode.com/things/

It's happened before - you want to do something important, but there's just no
time for it. Not today. So you decide to do it next week, or in two weeks. But
when the time comes, you have either forgotten about it, or you remember too
late.

With Things, all to-dos that are scheduled for today automatically appear at
the top of your Today list, together with all to-dos that have become due. We
call it Daily Review. It's a way for you to easily review which tasks you want
to start today, and which ones you want to postpone until later.

If not actionable,

- delete it
- record it as future (tickle date)

#+begin_verse
I've been using jira for task tracking and greenhopper for doing
sprint based development.

http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview
http://www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/overview

They're quite nice tools, especially in conjunction with greenhopper
used to prioritise which tasks need to be done.

You can purchase them for $10 for up to 10 users.
