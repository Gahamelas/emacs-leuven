* Tasks

** TODO Check for obsolete (deprecated) variables

** TODO Improve naming of hook functions

Don't put the name of the hook in there. Give them a semantic naming,
depending on what they really do.

** TODO Wrap =diff-= in an =eval-after-load=

... if possible

Check which packages do have =(require 'diff)=. Use them (or one of their
caller) in the =eval-after-load=.

** TODO Put missing packages (on a normal machine) in =eval-after-load=

** TODO Use =findstr= instead of =grep= on Windows
